description: >-
  Enclave is an open-source protocol for Encrypted Execution Environments (E3)
  that enables secure, verifiable computations on encrypted data using FHE,
  ZKPs, and DTC (distributed threshold cryptography).

  <br >

  <br>

  Special Features:

  <br>

  * Full Data Privacy: Encrypted data is never exposed at any point.

  <br>

  * Multiple Encrypted Inputs: Securely compute over data from multiple
  encrypted sources.

  <br>

  * Decoupled Execution and Security: Nodes responsible for key management are
  separate from those handling execution, lowering hardware requirements.

  <br>

  * Single-Use Keys: Keyshares are generated per computation request and are
  never reused, eliminating the need for key rotation even when nodes fail or
  misbehave.

  <br>

  * Built-In Economic Incentives: MPC parties are bonded and subject to
  penalties or slashing for misbehavior, ensuring the systemâ€™s security without
  compromising overall operation.

  <br>

  * Developer Accessibility: Programs can be written in Rust, making the system
  accessible to a broad developer base.

  <br>

  * Encryption Scheme Agnostic: Enclave's modular design allows it to support
  various threshold FHE encryption schemes.

  <br>

  <br>

  Enclave is applicable in industries like healthcare, finance, governance, and
  collaborative efforts that require secure data processing with strong privacy
  and compliance. It enables use cases such as secret voting, sealed-bid
  auctions, and privacy-preserving collaborative analysis that are difficult or
  impossible with traditional solutions.
