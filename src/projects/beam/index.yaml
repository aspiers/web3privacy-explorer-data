  - title: Fifth Hard-Fork (and wallet v7.1)
    description: As discussed on the Beam Forum, this hard-fork reduced the issuance
      cost of Confidential Assets from 3000 to 10 BEAM only. The result can be
      seen in the CAs being created (or re-created) after the fork. The
      hard-fork also added smart contracts enhancements allowing them to verify
      fork heights (to support fork-dependent features). On the wallet side,
      DApp support for the BANS (Beam Anonymous Name System) was improved.

  - title: Fourth Hard-Fork (and wallet v7.0)
    description: This hard-fork introduced 'High-Frequency Transactions' (HFTX) on
      both node and wallet sides, and IPFS storage integration on the wallet
      side. HFTX improve resistance to MEV, front-running and sandwich attacks
      by defining strict inclusion rules for transactions, thus protecting users
      from unwanted outcomes (as the submitted transactions can only be included
      into a block in their exact specific sequence). On the wallet side, the
      IPFS integration allows storing data (such as NFTs) efficiently in a
      decentralized manner while reducing blockchain bloat. Thus, every Beam
      wallet today is at the same time a blockchain node (to submit transactions
      and verify blocks), an SBBS node (to allow secure communication between
      wallets), and an IPFS node (to allow decentralized storage, including for
      DApp front ends distribution). This Hard Fork went smoothly and the
      difficulty remained fairly stable.

  - title: Third Hard-Fork (and wallet v6.0)
    description: "This hard-fork brought the addition of the Beam Virtual Machine
      (BVM) as an infrastructure to create Smart Contracts (a.k.a. 'Shaders'),
      thus making Beam the first privacy coin with smart contracts capabilities!
      BVM smart contracts can be written in any WebAssembly compatible language
      (such as C++, Rust, Go, etc.) and are composed of two elements: the
      blockchain side (running on Beam nodes) and the wallet side (running in
      Beam wallet, together with the DApp front ends). This separation of
      chain-side and client-side logics allows very powerful and flexible
      applications. Beam smart contracts are transparent by default, which means
      that we can see their state and their activity. Nevertheless, the users
      remain anonymous, as their interactions with the smart contracts are based
      on normal confidential Beam transactions. With this approach, Beam's DeFi
      manages to provide 'efficient' markets (e.g. where we can see what is
      bought and sold) while still protecting its users' privacy (e.g. we cannot
      see who buys and sells!). By allowing such privacy-preserving smart
      contract capabilities, this hard-fork opened the doors to Beam becoming
      not only a powerful 'Privacy DeFi' (PriFi) platform but indeed a
      general-purpose infrastructure for anything in Confidential Web3!"

  - title: Second Hard-Fork
    description: Beam's second hard-fork was performed as announced in the roadmap.
      The PoW algorithm was updated from BeamHash II to BeamHash III, which is
      the final version in the planned strategy to balance GPU and ASIC mining.
      This hard-fork also saw the activation of the Confidential Assets
      (sometimes also called 'Privacy Tokens', and which were introduced in the
      first hard-fork but kept inactive) and the release of the Lelantus-MW
      protocol and its associated one-side payments (also known as offline
      transactions).

  - title: First Hard-Fork
    description: Beam's first hard-fork was performed as announced in the roadmap.
      The PoW algorithm was updated from BeamHash I to BeamHash II, which are
      upgrades from the vanilla Equihash on which they are based. Beam's
      strategy with these planned changes of the mining algorithm was to give
      GPU miners a head start, and then allow cheap ASICs to join in without
      disrupting the mining ecosystem. After this hard-fork, a drop in
      difficulty was observed as not all miners performed a timely upgrade.
      However, after less than 24 hours, the hashrate had gone back to its
      pre-fork value.
